            <h2>Shermy</h2>
            <p>Shermy is one of Charlie Brown’s oldest friends, he was around even before Snoopy. He’s smart and reserved, but still has enough imagination to pretend. Shermy is always up for a game of catch, ready to take in a movie, or to just take a walk around the neighborhood. Shermy doesn’t speak to Charlie Brown quite as much as he did in the old days, but he’s always there in the background, ready to reminisce or play some baseball.</p>
