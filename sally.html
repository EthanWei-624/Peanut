        <h2>Sally</h2>
        <p>Sally is inquisitive and demands answers for everything. Why do kids have to go to school? Why not dessert first? When faced with a question she can’t answer, she tackles the problem with a classic philosophy: “Who cares?!” Her heart skips a beat when she sees her “Sweet Babboo,” Linus. And she knows that even though she may not understand him, she can always turn to her big brother, Charlie Brown, for help and encouragement.</p>
