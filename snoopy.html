        <h2>Snoopy</h2>
        <p>Snoopy is not your average beagle. He is a book lover and a book writer. He is a collector of fine art and a root beer connoisseur. Plus, his unstoppable imagination helps keep his life anything but ordinary. As the Flying Ace, he heroically battles the Red Baron. As Joe Cool, he is the big dog on campus. But no imaginary adventure matches a nap on his doghouseâ€”and waking up to a well-deserved supper made especially for him by that Round-Headed Kid.</p>
