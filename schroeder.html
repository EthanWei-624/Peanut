            <p>A moody musical genius, Schroeder has been playing the piano since before he could walk. He also enjoys baseball and being with friends, but he’s never happier than when playing a Beethoven piece—even if the black keys of his piano are just painted on. If only he could get Lucy to leave him alone long enough to make it through the first movement of the sonata!</p>
