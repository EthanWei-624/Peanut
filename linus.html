        <h2>Linus</h2>
        <p>Thoughtful and respectful, Linus is often the voice of reason among his peers. He is a deep thinker and a student of philosophy. Despite his run-ins with cantankerous Lucy, and the fact no one understands why he carries a security blanket, Linus remains delightfully hopeful. He’s certain that this year, the Great Pumpkin will appear…he just knows it… </p>
