        <h2>Woodstock</h2>
        <p>Woodstock is not a great flyer. In fact, he doesnâ€™t even know what type of bird he is. The only thing he knows for sure is that he and Snoopy were destined to be great pals. He refers to Snoopy as his friend of friends, the only one in the neighborhood who understands his chirps. Woodstock is always up for an adventure, but is just as happy relaxing at home.</p>
