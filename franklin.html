        <h2>franklin</h2>
        <p>Franklin is a busy kid: he plays baseball and is learning guitar, he’s a member of a swim club and of 4H. Though his life is active, Franklin is never too busy to help his friends. He is supportive and smart and always willing to lend a hand. He also enjoys spending time with his grandparents and learning about the old days from them. And even though he thinks Charlie Brown’s friends are a little weird, he’s happy to be part of the gang.</p>
