            <p>Patty is one of Charlie Brown’s oldest friends in the neighborhood. She’s been around since the beginning. Literally. Like many girls in the neighborhood, Patty has a complex relationship with Charlie Brown, happily playing and going to movies with him one day, then endlessly taunting him the next.</p>
