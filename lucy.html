            <h2>Lucy</h2>
            <p>Charlie Brown and Lucy have an extremely difficult time getting along. Lucy often bullies Charlie Brown for no reason at all; possibly just lazily for her own amusement. As a result, this leads to Charlie Brown often making vengeful comebacks. However, despite their current issues and circumstances, the two are still friends, and can get along, every now and then, from time to time.</p>
