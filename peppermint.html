        <p>Peppermint Patty is a natural athlete and the manager of her own baseball team. More than simply sporty, Patricia is also a thinker. She spends a lot of time sitting against the ‘thinking tree’ contemplating life and love. She can do just about anything…except study. She’s more sensitive than she lets on and speaks out loudly against any unfair treatment of herself or others.  Her adoring father refers to her as his “Rare Gem.”</p>
