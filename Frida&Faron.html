            <h2>Frida&Faron</h2>
            <p>The first thing you notice about Frieda is her naturally curly hair (if you don’t notice it, don’t worry—she’ll make sure to tell you all about it). When she’s not talking about herself or her naturally curly hair, she can often be seen playing outfield for Charlie Brown’s baseball team, planting flowers on his pitcher’s mound, or admonishing Snoopy for lying on his doghouse instead of chasing rabbits. Frieda’s near boneless cat, Faron, is known for his complete and utter lack of motion, which may explain why Frieda is so keen on keeping Snoopy active.</p>
